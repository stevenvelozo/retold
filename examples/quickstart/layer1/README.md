# Layer 1: Fable - The Foundation

> Retold Layer 1 — Core Ecosystem: dependency injection, configuration, logging,
> UUID generation, expressions

Fable is the foundation of every Retold application. All other modules depend on
it and register as services through the Fable service provider pattern.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## What This Demonstrates

- Creating a Fable instance with configuration
- Logging at different levels
- UUID generation
- The service provider pattern (creating and using custom services)
